//***FILE 487 is a TSO REXX exec from Robert Bridges, which can     *   FILE 487
//*           be used to ISPF VIEW the TSO terminal output of       *   FILE 487
//*           commands.  This way, the output would not roll off    *   FILE 487
//*           the screen.                                           *   FILE 487
//*                                                                 *   FILE 487
//*           For example, instead of typing:                       *   FILE 487
//*                                                                 *   FILE 487
//*             TSO HELP XMIT        under ISPF, getting the        *   FILE 487
//*                                  raw TSO output, you type       *   FILE 487
//*                                                                 *   FILE 487
//*             TSO DISP HELP XMIT   and you get to VIEW all        *   FILE 487
//*                                  the output under ISPF.         *   FILE 487
//*                                                                 *   FILE 487
//*           This exec is therefore very convenient to have.       *   FILE 487
